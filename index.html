            <p><i><b>The New York State LGBTQ+ Health and Human Services Network Needs Assessment</b></i> is one of the largest LGBTQ Health Surveys in the United States. With the aim to give voice to the needs and barriers to services for this underserved community, the extensive report provides insights into the current state and needs of the LGBTQ community, exploring disparities by race, ethnicity, age, gender, disabilities, religion, region of NYS, education, income, and more. 
             
              
               
                        The Network surveyed more than 2,300 respondents throughout New York State using a mixed-methods online survey tool.
                        <br><br>Conducted between September and November 2021 near the height of the pandemic, the survey also provides a unique capture of the impact of COVID-19 on the LGBTQ community and how it deepened and exacerbated existing inequalities. The following interactive visualizations explore key findings from this report, highlighting intersectional disparities within the LGBTQ community in need and access to key services, such as mental health.
                      <br><br>

            <h1>Generational shifts</h1>

<p><b>A generational shift is underway.</b> The 2021 Survey shows a community that has shifted substantially in terms of gender expression and identity since the last survey in 2015. The community is growing more diverse in gender identity and sexual orientation, such that binary gender identities and lesbian and gay orientations are trending toward minority status in the larger LGBTQ+ community. The shift is most pronounced in the breakdown of gender and orientation by three major age groups (13-34, 35-49, 50+). LGBTQ community members who are over 35 years of age identify primarily (72%) as either men or women (cis and trans), while those under 35 identify growingly as genderqueer, genderfluid, other genders, or non-binary (45%). Those 35+ report a higher need for care for chronic conditions and seem to need more information and education on mental health, while those under 35 report a higher need for mental health care (57.7%).
<br><br>These differences in orientation and gender expression point to substantially different lived experience in different age groups. To address the needs of the LGBTQ+ community today means creating appropriate resources and responses for youth, those in middle adulthood, and community members who are ageing.

                  <p> Disparities in needs, access, and outcomes in the LGBTQ+ community mirror the patterns of racial and ethnic health disparities at-large in American society. In the majority of needs and issues examined in the survey, non-White respondents report higher levels of needs and lower levels of receiving services than their White counterparts.
                    <br><br>In some areas the disparities are glaring — especially in terms of food security, obtaining public assistance, and receiving services sought in most service areas including chronic conditions, major health events, mental health, environmental health, and reproductive health. In 20 out of 23 different services non- White respondents reported a lower level of receiving services than White respondents.

Those born outside the US were also twice as likely to report abuse in relationships or the family, twice as likely to have reported environmental health concerns, and more likely to have experienced major health events (e.g., medical emergencies, surgeries, or major acute illness) but two-to-three times more likely to have not received services for major health events.

            <br><br>The mental health crisis is highly associated with experiences of discrimination and other factors associated with the psycho-social context of self-care and seeking services. The other factors include: high levels of medical mistrust, lower self-reported health, low self-reported quality of life, and a lack of social inclusion and support reported by up to half or more of the respondents. Addressing the psycho-social context of self-care requires action in multiple areas, such as addressing the shortage of mental health professionals, addressing the lack of clear and supported pathways to bring minority candidates into the profession, or supporting certified and trained peer positions that address issues of discrimination, fear, and mistrust in the community.

        <h3>Social inclusion and support, by New York State region</h3>
        To improve mental health outcomes, it is important to address social inclusion and specific community supports for individuals. This can mean social programming or community centers, but also through the affirmation of the LGBTQ+ community in health fairs, schools, libraries, parks, and other public places. Click on the drop-down menu below to see the distribution of survey respondents by NYS region who answered 'Somewhat' or 'Major' in response to each question on social isolation and support.

        <h1>Barriers to service</h1>
      <p>Even though services are needed by the LGBTQ community, 62.6% of respondents did not seek services - with over half of those not seeking services being 35 and younger. Respondents were asked about barriers to access services more generally. The survey asked, “How much of a problem is each of the following for seeking and obtaining the health care services or opportunities you need?” The survey provided a list of factors that could make seeking care difficult. Respondents used a 4-point scale: 1 = ”Not at all;” 2 = “Very slight problem;” 3 = “Somewhat of a problem;” and 4 = “Major Problem.” The following is the percentage respondents who cited that these categories were ‘somewhat’ or ‘major’ barriers to services.</p>
