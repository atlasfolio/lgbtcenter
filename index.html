            <p><i><b>The New York State LGBTQ+ Health and Human Services Network Needs Assessment</b></i> is among the most comprehensive LGBTQ health surveys in the U.S. It aims to highlight the needs and service barriers faced by this underserved community, offering detailed insights into disparities influenced by race, ethnicity, age, gender, disabilities, religion, region, education, income, and more. Conducted online from September to November 2021 during the pandemic peak, the survey involved over 2,300 respondents and captures the profound impact of COVID-19 on LGBTQ individuals, exacerbating pre-existing inequalities.<br><br>This digital overview of the report highlights key findings, including intersectional disparities and access to essential services like mental health.

            <h1>Generational shifts</h1>

<p><b>A generational shift is underway.</b> The 2021 Survey shows a community that has shifted substantially in terms of gender expression and identity since the last survey in 2015. The community is growing more diverse in gender identity and sexual orientation, such that binary gender identities and lesbian and gay orientations are trending toward minority status in the larger LGBTQ+ community. The shift is most pronounced in the breakdown of gender and orientation by three major age groups <i>(13-34, 35-49, 50+).</i> LGBTQ community members who are over 35 years of age identify primarily (72%) as either men or women (cis and trans), while those under 35 identify growingly as genderqueer, genderfluid, other genders, or non-binary (45%). Those 35+ report a higher need for care for chronic conditions and seem to need more information and education on mental health, while those under 35 report a higher need for mental health care (57.7%).
<br><br>These differences in orientation and gender expression point to substantially different lived experience in different age groups. To address the needs of the LGBTQ+ community today means creating appropriate resources and responses for youth, those in middle adulthood, and community members who are ageing.

                  <p><u>Disparities in needs, access, and outcomes in the LGBTQ+ community mirror the patterns of racial and ethnic health disparities at-large in American society.</u> In the majority of needs and issues examined in the survey, non-White respondents report higher levels of needs and lower levels of receiving services than their White counterparts.
                    <br><br>In some areas the disparities are glaring — especially in terms of food security, obtaining public assistance, and receiving services sought in most service areas including chronic conditions, major health events, mental health, environmental health, and reproductive health. In 20 out of 23 different services non-White respondents reported a lower level of receiving services than White respondents.

            <h1>Mental health</h1>

<p>
    <b>Mental health is the both the biggest support need and the greatest opportunity</b> for improving the well-being and quality of life of the LGBTQ community in New York State. The survey shows that 78% of respondents struggle with mental health issues, yet 30% are unable to access necessary services. 47% of those who looked for but did not obtain these services cited the absence of such services in their area as the primary obstacle.
    
    </p>
        Nine of every ten respondents (89%) reported some substance use (including alcohol and tobacco), with half (50%) reporting using only one or two substances. Another fifth (18%) reported using three substances, and another fifth (21%) reported using four or more substances.
            Respondents reported feeling the following at least <i>‘sometimes, half the time or most of the time':</i>  <br><br>

            <br><br>The mental health crisis is highly associated with experiences of discrimination and other factors associated with the psycho-social context of self-care and seeking services. The other factors include: <i>high levels of medical mistrust, lower self-reported health, low self-reported quality of life, and a lack of social inclusion and support</i> reported by up to half or more of the respondents.<br><br>Addressing the psycho-social context of self-care requires action in multiple areas, such as addressing the shortage of mental health professionals, addressing the lack of clear and supported pathways to bring minority candidates into the profession, or supporting certified and trained peer positions that address issues of discrimination, fear, and mistrust in the community.

        <h3>Social inclusion and support, by New York State region</h3>
        To improve mental health outcomes, it is important to address social inclusion and specific community supports for individuals. This can mean social programming or community centers, but also through the affirmation of the LGBTQ+ community in health fairs, schools, libraries, parks, and other public places.

        <h1>Barriers to service</h1>
        <p>While there is a significant demand for services within the LGBTQ community, a large portion (62.6%) of respondents did not seek out the care or services they need. Among these, individuals under 35 represented over half who refrained from seeking support. 
            Among those who did seek non-behavioral services but were unsuccessful, 29% said they could not find the required services locally.</p>

<h1>From insights to policy action</h1><br>
<p><b>The findings of this survey highlight several areas for policy action:</p></b><br>
<h2>Guarantee Funding for Life-Saving LGBTQ-Affirming Services</h2>
<p>Network members reach over 1.5 million New Yorkers every year. In many cases, we are the only LGBTQ-affirming provider in a radius of several counties. For the state, sustaining and expanding the capacity of Network members to reach out and serve their communities and meet them where they are is one of the most efficient ways to improve the health outcomes of LGBTQ New Yorkers. Each dollar invested in The Network returns up to 16 dollars in savings on future medical costs.</p>
<br>
<h2>Expand In-Person and Remote Service Capacity</h2>
<p>Fund and support the training, technical assistance, and support to public and private service providers to increase the state's capacity to serve its LGBTQ constituents. We recognize the importance and work to educate the public about the importance of extended LGBTQ cultural competency training and improved LGBT-affirming policies, regulations, and service standards.</p>
<br>
<h2>Guarantee the expansion of Telehealth Services</h2>
<p>Incentivize service providers to increase service availability by compensating behavioral and nonbehavioral telehealth services at competitive rates for organizations.</p>

         <div class="column" id="column2">
     

     <br><br><br>
            <h2>Find people where they are</h2>
            <p>Invest in developing targeted programming to reach historically marginalized groups within our communities: BIPOC communities, younger and aging clients, people with disabilities, immigrants, and TGNC clients.</p>
            
            <h2>Center a Holistic Approach to Health</h2>
            <p>On top of medical services, focus on a broader definition of health and wellness by funding programs centering: on mental health, insurance navigation, community-building, mutual aid, food and housing security, and culturally-competent services for employment, abuse in family and relationships, substance abuse, and immigration services.</p>
